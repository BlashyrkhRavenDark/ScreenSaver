# ScreenSaver
This is a C# Screensaver that displays album covers from your computer as a mozaique, changing every second.

Ever wanted to have a cool screensaver like the default iTunes screensaver on Mac, except on Windows? Well, there you go.

It looks like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUvwzdiCS0g

It needs ID3Lib and MP3Lib libraries.

How does it work?
A companion application (AlbumCoverFinder) parses a folder for MP3s and extracts album covers into a local database.
This database is then used by the Screensaver to display covers.

Installation instructions to follow.
